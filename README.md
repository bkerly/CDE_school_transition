# CDE School Transition

The purpose of this script is to estimate the school kids are in next year based on prior CDE data. 

Basically, we're going to see where kids who are the maximum grade in their school in one year go the next year. 

Ideally we'll be able to reconstruct the feeder school systems.

It won't work perfectly! But we'll see.
